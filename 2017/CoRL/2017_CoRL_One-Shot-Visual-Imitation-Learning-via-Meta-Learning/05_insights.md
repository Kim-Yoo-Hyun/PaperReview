## Paper-supported conclusion

> **Evidence boundary:** 현재 내용은 registry와 기존 curation cue를 정리한 것이다. 자동 추출이나 local PDF 보유는 정독 근거로 간주하지 않으며, 상세 claim은 full-text 확인이 필요하다.

### What was actually new

- **Method cue:** Our proposed architecture consists of three modules: the demonstration network, the context network, and the manipulation network.
- **Problem cue:** To accomplish this, we must solve two broad problems.
- **Claim/result cue:** Our experiments show that the use of soft attention allows the model to generalize to conditions and tasks unseen in the training data.

### Strongest assumption and failure boundary

- Explicit assumptions and negative results are not recorded in the current source note; full-text review is required.

## Researcher interpretation

### Reusable lesson in the robotics loop

- **Closed-loop position:** `policy/control → contact → feedback`.
- **Registry interface:** `Robotics, Imitation Learning, meta-learning, visual manipulation` is the paper's recorded topic/interface, not evidence that the full robotics loop was evaluated.
- Reuse the paper by preserving its input/output boundary and testing downstream success, failure, and latency under a matched baseline budget.

### Dependency and evolution

- Registry position: `Robot Learning and Data`; tags: `Robotics, Imitation Learning, meta-learning, visual manipulation`.
- A direct citation predecessor/successor is not recorded in the legacy note; confirm it from references and the track synthesis before asserting lineage.
- Recorded scope boundary/future cue:
  - 논문이 도달한 지점: Our experiments show that the use of soft attention allows the model to generalize to conditions and tasks unseen in the training data.
  - 논문 내 한계/논의 단서: There are a lot of exciting directions for future work.

### Minimal reproduction

- **Protocol carried forward from the legacy note (candidate, not a verified paper evaluation):**
  - 논문 내 evaluation 단서: 자동 추출에서 명확한 dataset 단서 없음 / mAP, success rate
  - 내 연구 확장 benchmark 후보: ScanNet, Matterport3D, nuScenes, CALVIN
  - 내 연구 확장 metric 후보: mIoU, accuracy, success rate, generalization gap
  - 검증 초점: paper task 성능과 3D/robotics downstream utility를 함께 확인한다.
- Do not label a candidate benchmark, metric, or extension protocol as the paper's own evaluation until the experiment section is checked.

## Falsifiable research question

고정된 sensing/control rate에서 Robotics, Imitation Learning, meta-learning, visual manipulation interface가 직접 joint-action baseline보다 contact loss와 force/pose error를 줄이는가?

**Reject the hypothesis if** the primary metric does not improve at a matched budget, or if the method adds latency, failure, or assumption sensitivity without a compensating closed-loop benefit.
