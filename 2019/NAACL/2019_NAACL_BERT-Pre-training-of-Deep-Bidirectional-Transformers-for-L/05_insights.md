> **Evidence boundary:** 현재 내용은 registry와 기존 curation cue를 정리한 것이다. 자동 추출이나 local PDF 보유는 정독 근거로 간주하지 않으며, 상세 claim은 full-text 확인이 필요하다.

### What was actually new

- **Method cue:** We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.
- **Problem cue:** The major limitation is that standard language models are unidirectional, and this limits the choice of architectures that can be used during pre-training.
- **Claim/result cue:** It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute ...

### Strongest assumption and failure boundary

- Explicit assumptions and negative results are not recorded in the current source note; full-text review is required.

## Researcher interpretation

### Reusable lesson in the robotics loop

- **Closed-loop position:** `observation/language → task decision → action/control`.
- **Registry interface:** `LLM, Transformer, pretraining` is the paper's recorded topic/interface, not evidence that the full robotics loop was evaluated.
- **Prior interpretation carried forward:**
  - Attention 기반 token interaction을 3D object, scene, map, trajectory token 사이의 long-range relation modeling에 사용할 수 있다.
  - Sequence modeling의 병렬화/장거리 의존성 처리를 embodied memory, planning history, multi-view observation aggregation으로 확장할 수 있다.
- Reuse the paper by preserving its input/output boundary and testing downstream success, failure, and latency under a matched baseline budget.

### Dependency and evolution

- Registry position: `Foundations: Vision and Language Models`; tags: `LLM, Transformer, pretraining`.
- A direct citation predecessor/successor is not recorded in the legacy note; confirm it from references and the track synthesis before asserting lineage.
- Recorded scope boundary/future cue:
  - 논문이 도달한 지점: It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute ...
  - 원 논문이 sequence/language task에서 보인 구조는 metric 3D geometry, SE(3) consistency, sensor noise, robot execution constraint를 직접 다루지 않는다.

### Minimal reproduction

- **Protocol carried forward from the legacy note (candidate, not a verified paper evaluation):**
  - 논문 내 evaluation 단서: ImageNet / accuracy
  - 내 연구 확장 benchmark 후보: ScanNet, Matterport3D, R2R, CALVIN
  - 내 연구 확장 metric 후보: accuracy, mIoU, SR, success rate
  - 검증 초점: 3D relation reasoning, spatial memory, language-conditioned planning 성능을 확인한다.
- Do not label a candidate benchmark, metric, or extension protocol as the paper's own evaluation until the experiment section is checked.

## Falsifiable research question

3D point/object/map/action token에 attention을 적용할 때 어떤 positional encoding이 metric geometry를 보존하는가?

**Reject the hypothesis if** the primary metric does not improve at a matched budget, or if the method adds latency, failure, or assumption sensitivity without a compensating closed-loop benefit.
