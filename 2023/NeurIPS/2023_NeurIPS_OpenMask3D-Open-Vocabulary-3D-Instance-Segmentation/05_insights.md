### What was actually new

- **Method cue:** We propose OpenMask3D, the first open-vocabulary 3D instance 1 Our approach takes as input posed segmentation model.
- **Problem cue:** Hence, the second key problem with closed-vocabulary approaches is their inherent limitation to recognize only object classes that are predefined at training time.
- **Claim/result cue:** Experiments and ablation studies on ScanNet200 and Replica show that OpenMask3D outperforms other open-vocabulary methods, especially on the long-tail distribution.

### Strongest assumption and failure boundary

- Explicit assumptions and negative results are not recorded in the current source note; full-text review is required.

## Researcher interpretation

### Reusable lesson in the robotics loop

- **Closed-loop position:** `observation → state/world model`.
- **Registry interface:** `open-vocabulary, 3D segmentation, CLIP` is the paper's recorded topic/interface, not evidence that the full robotics loop was evaluated.
- **Prior interpretation carried forward:**
  - 2D vision-language feature를 3D object/point/field/map에 정렬해 open-vocabulary querying과 semantic grounding에 사용할 수 있다.
  - 핵심은 language prior를 3D metric structure와 맞추면서 view inconsistency와 hallucination을 줄이는 것이다.
- Reuse the paper by preserving its input/output boundary and testing downstream success, failure, and latency under a matched baseline budget.

### Dependency and evolution

- Registry position: `Embodied Navigation and Mapping`; tags: `open-vocabulary, 3D segmentation, CLIP`.
- A direct citation predecessor/successor is not recorded in the legacy note; confirm it from references and the track synthesis before asserting lineage.
- Recorded scope boundary/future cue:
  - 논문이 도달한 지점: Experiments and ablation studies on ScanNet200 and Replica show that OpenMask3D outperforms other open-vocabulary methods, especially on the long-tail distribution.
  - open-vocabulary recognition이나 grounding을 보인 뒤에도 3D consistency, ambiguous reference resolution, robot-action relevance는 남는다.

### Minimal reproduction

- **Protocol carried forward from the legacy note (candidate, not a verified paper evaluation):**
  - 논문 내 evaluation 단서: ScanNet, ScanNet200, Replica, LERF / accuracy, AP
  - 내 연구 확장 benchmark 후보: ScanNet, ScanRefer, ReferIt3D, SQA3D
  - 내 연구 확장 metric 후보: mIoU, Acc@0.25, Acc@0.5, Recall@K
  - 검증 초점: open-vocabulary segmentation/localization, 3D consistency, task-relevant grounding을 확인한다.
- Do not label a candidate benchmark, metric, or extension protocol as the paper's own evaluation until the experiment section is checked.

## Falsifiable research question

2D VLM feature를 3D로 lift할 때 multi-view consistency와 fine-grained object boundary를 동시에 유지할 수 있는가?

**Reject the hypothesis if** the primary metric does not improve at a matched budget, or if the method adds latency, failure, or assumption sensitivity without a compensating closed-loop benefit.
