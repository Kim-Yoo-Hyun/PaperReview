### What was actually new

- **Method cue:** The robotic motion planning problem has received a considerable amount of attention, especially over the last decade, as robots started becoming a vital part of modern industry as ...
- **Problem cue:** An algorithm to address this problem is said to be complete if it terminates in finite time, returning a valid solution if one exists, and failure otherwise.
- **Claim/result cue:** A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g., showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms ...

### Strongest assumption and failure boundary

- Explicit assumptions and negative results are not recorded in the current source note; full-text review is required.

## Researcher interpretation

### Reusable lesson in the robotics loop

- **Closed-loop position:** `task & motion decision → policy/control`.
- **Registry interface:** `Robotics, motion planning, RRT*, asymptotic optimality` is the paper's recorded topic/interface, not evidence that the full robotics loop was evaluated.
- Reuse the paper by preserving its input/output boundary and testing downstream success, failure, and latency under a matched baseline budget.

### Dependency and evolution

- Registry position: `Robotics Foundations: Planning and Control`; tags: `Robotics, motion planning, RRT*, asymptotic optimality`.
- A direct citation predecessor/successor is not recorded in the legacy note; confirm it from references and the track synthesis before asserting lineage.
- Recorded scope boundary/future cue:
  - 논문이 도달한 지점: A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g., showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms ...
  - 논문 내 한계/논의 단서: In order to address these limitations of existing algorithms, a number of new algorithms are introduced, and proven to be asymptotically optimal and computational efficient, with respect to ...

### Minimal reproduction

- **Protocol carried forward from the legacy note (candidate, not a verified paper evaluation):**
  - 논문 내 evaluation 단서: 자동 추출에서 명확한 dataset 단서 없음 / mAP, collision
  - 내 연구 확장 benchmark 후보: ScanNet, Matterport3D, nuScenes, CALVIN
  - 내 연구 확장 metric 후보: mIoU, accuracy, success rate, generalization gap
  - 검증 초점: paper task 성능과 3D/robotics downstream utility를 함께 확인한다.
- Do not label a candidate benchmark, metric, or extension protocol as the paper's own evaluation until the experiment section is checked.

## Falsifiable research question

고정된 state, action, compute budget에서 Robotics, motion planning, RRT*, asymptotic optimality formulation이 task cost 또는 success를 유지하면서 perturbation 이후 recovery를 개선하는가?

**Reject the hypothesis if** the primary metric does not improve at a matched budget, or if the method adds latency, failure, or assumption sensitivity without a compensating closed-loop benefit.
