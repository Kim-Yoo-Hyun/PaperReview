### What was actually new

- **Method cue:** Specifically, our method consists of two stages: a heterogeneous graph structure learning (HGSL) stage and a heterogeneous graph reasoning (HGR) stage.
- **Problem cue:** Although remarkable progress has been made in recent years, 3D SGP remains highly challenging as 1) 3D point cloud data is typically sparse and irregular in spatial dimension.
- **Claim/result cue:** Extensive experiments show that our method achieves comparable or superior performance to existing methods on 3DSSG dataset.

### Strongest assumption and failure boundary

- Explicit assumptions and negative results are not recorded in the current source note; full-text review is required.

## Researcher interpretation

### Reusable lesson in the robotics loop

- **Closed-loop position:** `observation/language → task decision → action/control`.
- **Registry interface:** `3D Vision, Graph Reasoning` is the paper's recorded topic/interface, not evidence that the full robotics loop was evaluated.
- **Prior interpretation carried forward:**
  - Object, relation, room/scene hierarchy를 graph로 구조화해 3D perception 결과를 robot planning과 language reasoning에 넘기는 중간 표현으로 사용할 수 있다.
  - 관계 중심 표현은 단일 object detection보다 task-relevant affordance, spatial relation, commonsense reasoning을 붙이기 쉽다.
- Reuse the paper by preserving its input/output boundary and testing downstream success, failure, and latency under a matched baseline budget.

### Dependency and evolution

- Registry position: `3D Vision-Language Understanding`; tags: `3D Vision, Graph Reasoning`.
- A direct citation predecessor/successor is not recorded in the legacy note; confirm it from references and the track synthesis before asserting lineage.
- Recorded scope boundary/future cue:
  - 논문이 도달한 지점: Extensive experiments show that our method achieves comparable or superior performance to existing methods on 3DSSG dataset.
  - 저자가 남긴 확장 방향: In the future, we plan to investigate the heterogeneity and hierarchy of 3D objects to minimize the gap between machine and human brain comprehension of the real world ...
  - static scene graph 품질을 보인 뒤에도 dynamic updates, uncertainty, open-vocabulary relation grounding, robot action coupling은 별도 문제로 남는다.

### Minimal reproduction

- **Protocol carried forward from the legacy note (candidate, not a verified paper evaluation):**
  - 논문 내 evaluation 단서: 3RScan / accuracy
  - 내 연구 확장 benchmark 후보: ScanNet, 3RScan, Matterport3D
  - 내 연구 확장 metric 후보: mIoU, Recall@K, relation accuracy, task success
  - 검증 초점: relation prediction, open-vocabulary grounding, downstream planning utility를 확인한다.
- Do not label a candidate benchmark, metric, or extension protocol as the paper's own evaluation until the experiment section is checked.

## Falsifiable research question

3D scene graph의 node/edge uncertainty를 planning cost나 action selection에 어떻게 반영할 수 있는가?

**Reject the hypothesis if** the primary metric does not improve at a matched budget, or if the method adds latency, failure, or assumption sensitivity without a compensating closed-loop benefit.
