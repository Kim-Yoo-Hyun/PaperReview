### What was actually new

- **Method cue:** In this paper, we propose a fully-learned system that allows bipedal robots to react to local terrain while maintaining commanded travel speed and direction.
- **Problem cue:** Robustly achieving such an integration of vision and locomotion remains an open problem for bipedal robots.
- **Claim/result cue:** We demonstrate that with appropriate domain randomization, this approach allows for successful sim-to-real transfer with no explicit pose estimation and no fine-tuning using real-world data.

### Strongest assumption and failure boundary

- Explicit assumptions and negative results are not recorded in the current source note; full-text review is required.

## Researcher interpretation

### Reusable lesson in the robotics loop

- **Closed-loop position:** `observation → state/world model`.
- **Registry interface:** `Robotics, bipedal locomotion, sim-to-real, Reinforcement Learning` is the paper's recorded topic/interface, not evidence that the full robotics loop was evaluated.
- Reuse the paper by preserving its input/output boundary and testing downstream success, failure, and latency under a matched baseline budget.

### Dependency and evolution

- Registry position: `Locomotion, Whole-Body, and Mobile Manipulation`; tags: `Robotics, bipedal locomotion, sim-to-real, Reinforcement Learning`.
- A direct citation predecessor/successor is not recorded in the legacy note; confirm it from references and the track synthesis before asserting lineage.
- Recorded scope boundary/future cue:
  - 논문이 도달한 지점: We demonstrate that with appropriate domain randomization, this approach allows for successful sim-to-real transfer with no explicit pose estimation and no fine-tuning using real-world data.

### Minimal reproduction

- **Protocol carried forward from the legacy note (candidate, not a verified paper evaluation):**
  - 논문 내 evaluation 단서: 자동 추출에서 명확한 dataset 단서 없음 / mAP, success rate, collision
  - 내 연구 확장 benchmark 후보: ScanNet, Matterport3D, nuScenes, CALVIN
  - 내 연구 확장 metric 후보: mIoU, accuracy, success rate, generalization gap
  - 검증 초점: paper task 성능과 3D/robotics downstream utility를 함께 확인한다.
- Do not label a candidate benchmark, metric, or extension protocol as the paper's own evaluation until the experiment section is checked.

## Falsifiable research question

고정된 sensor·compute budget에서 Robotics, bipedal locomotion, sim-to-real, Reinforcement Learning 기반 표현이 robot-relevant state 품질과 downstream task success를 sensor noise와 partial observation 아래 개선하는가?

**Reject the hypothesis if** the primary metric does not improve at a matched budget, or if the method adds latency, failure, or assumption sensitivity without a compensating closed-loop benefit.
